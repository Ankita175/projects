                <h3>
                    <p> “Superfoods” is a word often used for nutrient-rich ingredients that confer major health benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides promoting overall health, many superfoods contain specific compounds, antioxidants, and micronutrients that may enhance weight loss.</p>
        
                    <p>Here are 20 of the best superfoods for weight loss, all backed by science.</p>
        
                    <p><strong>1.<u>Kale</u></strong></p>
                    <div class="img">
                        <img src="img/kale.png" alt="Kale" style="width: 75%; height: 450px; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
                    </div>
                    <p>Kale is a leafy green vegetable that’s well known for its health-promoting properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s a great source of antioxidants and several key nutrients, including manganese and vitamins C and vitamin K.</p>
        
                    <p>Kale is also low in calories and high in fiber, a compound that moves slowly through the digestive tract and helps keep you feeling fuller for longer, which may support weight loss.</p>
        
                    <p>Try adding kale to your favorite salads, sautéing it with garlic for an easy side dish, or using it to add a pop of color to pasta dishes.</p>
        
                    <p><strong>2.<u>Berries</u></strong></p>
                    <div class="img">
                        <img src="img/berries.png" alt="Berries" style="width: 75%; height: 450px; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
                    </div>
        <p>Berries like strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries are vibrant, flavorful, and highly nutritious.
        </p>
        <p>For example, blueberries are rich in fiber and vitamins C and K.
        </p>
        <p>They can also help satisfy your sweet tooth while providing fewer calories than many other high sugar snacks or desserts.
        </p>
        <p>Berries work well in smoothies or as a topping for yogurt or oatmeal. They also make an excellent snack, either on their own or combined with other fruits in a fruit salad.</p>
        
        
        <p><strong>3.<u>Broccoli</u></strong></p>
        <div class="img">
            <img src="img/broccoli.png" alt="Broccoli" style="width: 75%; height: 450px; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
        </div>
        <p>Broccoli is a nutrient-dense superfood and an excellent addition to a healthy weight loss diet.</p>
        
        <p>In particular, broccoli is a great source of fiber and micronutrients, such as vitamin C, folate, potassium, and manganese.
        </p>
        <p>Multiple studies also show that upping your intake of cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, could help prevent weight gain over time.</p>
        
        <p>Add a bit of garlic, lemon juice, or Parmesan — or all three — to your broccoli for a quick and easy side dish. You can also try adding broccoli to salads, casseroles, quiches, or pasta dishes to ramp up their nutritional value.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.<u>Chia seeds</u></strong></p>
        <div class="img">
            <img src="img/chia seeds.png" alt="Chia Seeds" style="width: 75%; height: 450px; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
        </div>
        <p>Chia seeds are loaded with important nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, magnesium, and manganese.
        </p>
        <p>They’re also packed with soluble fiber, which is a type of fiber that absorbs water and forms a gel in the digestive tract.</p>
        
        <p>Research suggests that consuming soluble fiber may be linked to increased weight loss and body fat loss.</p>
        
        <p>Chia seeds are also high in protein, which can help reduce hunger and regulate your appetite.</p>
        
        <p>Try sprinkling chia seeds over your favorite smoothies, yogurts, or oat bowls to enhance the flavor and texture.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>5.<u>Eggs</u></strong></p>
        <div class="img">
            <img src="img/eggs.png" alt="Eggs" style="width: 75%; height: 450px; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
        </div>
        <p>Eggs are versatile, delicious, and simple to prepare. It’s easy to see why they’re one of the best superfoods for weight loss.</p>
        
        <p>In fact, eggs are packed with a variety of essential vitamins and minerals in each serving, including selenium, vitamin B12, riboflavin, and phosphorus.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, eggs are brimming with protein, which can help promote feelings of fullness to boost weight loss.</p>
        
        <p>Hard-boiled eggs make a great snack sprinkled with some salt and pepper or a bit of hot sauce. You can also enjoy eggs in omelets, quiches, breakfast burritos, and stir-fries.</p>
